# Farm-Dairy-App
Farm Diary application: I created this console-based tool to provide a simple, fast, and efficient way for small farmers to digitally track their activities and manage their finances.
This project is a pure command-line application written in C. The core logic revolves around C structs to organize data, standard input/output functions for user interaction, and robust file I/O operations (fopen, fprintf, fgets) to save and retrieve all diary entries from a local CSV file. The focus was on creating a lightweight and resource-efficient program with no external dependencies.

Key Features:

• Comprehensive Logging: Easily add entries for sowing/planting, expenses, and harvests.

• Persistent Data: All diary entries are saved locally to a farm_diary.csv file, ensuring data is never lost between sessions.

• Detailed Log View: Users can view a complete, chronologically sorted history of all their farm activities.

• Automated Financial Summary: Instantly calculates and displays total income, total expenses, and the net profit or loss, providing a clear financial overview.

• Lightweight & Fast: Being a native C application, it runs instantly on any terminal with minimal memory usage.

This Farm Diary App is designed to empower small-scale farmers by: 
Digitalizing Records: Moving them from pen-and-paper to a simple digital log.
Improving Financial Tracking: Providing a clear, up-to-date picture of profitability.
Enabling Better Decision-Making: Helping farmers analyze their expenses and income to plan for the future.
This project was a fantastic challenge that deepened my understanding of data structures, memory management, and file handling in C. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions!
